Building
-------------
The application can be built using CMake for Windows.
CMake can be downloaded from the following URL: https://cmake.org/download/
Assuming CMake is installed in the PATH, navigate to the project directory in Command Prompt and enter 'cmake .'
The compiled .exe should then be found in the directory 'out\build\x64-Debug (default)'
Alternatively, Visual Studio 2019 can be used to open the CMake project.
